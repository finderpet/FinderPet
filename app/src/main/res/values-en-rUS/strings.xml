            &lt;b>FinderPet data policy&lt;/b>
            &lt;br>&lt;/br>
            &lt;p align="justify">This policy describes the information we process in order to provide FinderPet services, as well as other products and features that FinderPet offers (“FinderPet Ads” or “FinderPet Products and Services”).&lt;/p>

        &lt;/div>

        &lt;div>
        &lt;b>I. ¿What types of information do we collect?&lt;/b>
        &lt;br>&lt;/br>
        We must process your information in order to provide you with the FinderPet Products. The type of information we collect depends on how you use our application. Learn how to access the data we collect and how to delete it in FinderPet settings.



        Things that you and other people do and provide to us.

        Information and content that you provide us. We collect the content, communications and other data that you provide when you use our Products, for example, when you register for an account, create or share content. This information may correspond to data included in the content you provide (for example, metadata) or related to it, such as the place where a photo was taken or the date of creation of a file or publication. It can also include the content that you see through the features we make available to you, such as the camera, as well as give you tips on how to use camera formats. Our systems automatically process the content and communications that you and others provide to analyze the context and what they include in relation to the purposes described below.
        &lt;br>&lt;/br>
             &lt;b>Special category data:&lt;/b>You can choose to provide information in the fields on your FinderPet profile.
        &lt;br>&lt;/br>
        &lt;b>Your use:&lt;/b> We collect information about how you use our app, such as the types of content you view or interact with, the features you use, the actions you take, and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. For example, we record when you are using and when you have last used our Products, and what posts and other content you see on our app. We also collect information about how you use features like our camera.

        &lt;br>&lt;/br>
         &lt;b>Device features:&lt;/b>information such as operating system, hardware and software version, battery charge level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, application or file types and names, and plug-ins .
        &lt;br>&lt;/br>
        &lt;b>Device operations:&lt;/b>information about the operations and behaviors performed on the device, such as placing a window in the foreground or background, or mouse movements (which distinguishes humans from bots).
        Device configuration data: information that allows us to receive when activating the corresponding configuration in the device, such as access to the GPS location, the camera and the photos.

        &lt;/p>

        &lt;/div>


        &lt;p>
        &lt;b>II.How do we use this information?&lt;/b>
        &lt;br>&lt;/br>
        We use the information we have (in accordance with the decisions you make) as described below to provide the FinderPet Products and related services described in the Terms of Use, as well as to ensure their operation. We use this data for the following aspects:
        &lt;br>&lt;/br>
        &lt;b>Provide, personalize and improve our Products.&lt;/b>
        We use the information we have to offer our Products, as well as to personalize the functions and content (including advertisements, the section of posts of found, lost or adopted pets), and to provide suggestions (such as groups or events that you may interest or topics that you may want to follow) both inside and outside our Products. In order to create personalized Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data that we collect and that you and others provide us (including those data from special categories that you choose to provide us with) as well as the way in which you use and interact with our Products and the people, places or things that you connect with and in which you show interest, both inside and outside of our Products.
        &lt;br>&lt;/br>
        &lt;b>Location-related information:&lt;/b>We use location-related information, such as your current location, to provide, personalize, and improve our Products, including advertisements, to make them more relevant to you and others. This type of information may be based on data such as the precise location of the device (if you have allowed us to collect this information), IP addresses, and usage information for FinderPet Products.
        &lt;br>&lt;/br>

       illicit act or that property or rights of a third party liable to compensation are injured, any
       type of responsibility regarding privacy and data processing of other applications. The
       Navigation and interaction in any other application or website, including those that are linked to the application, is subject to the rules and policies of said site. We recommend that the User read the policies of

       or in any other way.

       &lt;h5 align="left">Links on other websites to the application.&lt;/h5>
       If any third party, entity or website wishes to establish some type of link to the application, it must respect the following:

               URL address of the Website covering the entire extension of the Website screen. In no case,

               establishes the link, it will not be possible to declare that the Company has authorized such a link, unless there is so
               expressly authorized in writing by the Company. If the entity that makes the link from your page
               the application will want to include the brand, denomination, trade name, label,
               logo, slogan or any other type of identifying element of the Company and / or the application,
               You must first have your express written authorization.&lt;/li>

             This application was developed by two enthusiastic programmers who found a need through a very common problem in our environment.
        &lt;/div>
        &lt;br>&lt;/br>
        &lt;div>
            &lt;b>Johan Martínez,&lt;/b> is a Systems Engineer with a passion for programming and technology, he has dedicated a lot of his free time to carry out this FinderPet development.
        &lt;div>
        &lt;div>
            &lt;b>Johnnatan Velásquez,&lt;/b> He is a Software Development student who begins to grow in the programming environment, in addition, he has worked in recent years in environments where pets are the center of attention.
        &lt;/div>

        Together, they started this venture that is now a reality and that is helping many people find their pets, either because they lost their way or because they made the decision to adopt one.
